# Krosai Project

Welcome to Krosai, a cross-platform AI harmony eco-library built using Kotlin multiplatform. We hope to empower kotlin with the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and build a bridge between multiple platforms.

## Projects

1. **Krosai**: A cross-platform multi-model Kotlin AI framework project. Provides a foundation for building AI models that can be invoked on multiple platforms, enabling AI to empower Kotlin.

2. **Krossit**: A cross-platform AI assistant. Based on **Krosai**, supports a variety of custom contexts and client-side local function calls, providing users with a unified experience on different platforms.

## Future Plans

Our future plans include the development of **Krossit** and the continuous exploration of the **Krosai** project to improve the experience.
