# Krosai Project
Welcome to **Krosai**, a cross-platform AI ecosystem library built with Kotlin Multiplatform. It bridges the gap between multiple platforms and empowers Kotlin with Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## About the name
The name "Krosai" is a combination of two elements: "Kros-" and "-ai", taken from the initial letters of "Cross-platform" and "Artificial Intelligence".
* "Kros-" implies cross-platform, indicating that our project can run on various platforms.
* "-ai" represents artificial intelligence, indicating that our project is AI-centric.

## Projects
1. **Krosai**: A cross-platform multi-AI model Kotlin AI framework project. It provides the ability to invoke AI models on multiple platforms for Kotlin, empowering Kotlin with AI.
2. **Krossit**: A cross-platform AI assistant. Based on **Krosai**, it supports multiple custom contexts and local client function calls, providing users with a unified assistant experience on different platforms.

## Future Plans
Our future plans include:
1. Developing the **Krossit** project with functionalities that reinforce user experience and capability.
2. Enhance the **Krosai** project with more AI model support and more functional features.
